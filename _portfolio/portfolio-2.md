We develop this project based on an integration framework on Ethrereum Blockchain. The main idea is awarding token to people who upload their odometer data to blockchain and people can use the token to buy other's odometer data from the data market. The odometer data is encrypted locally before uploading to blockchain and the original encrypted data would be stored in the cloud database and the hash would upload on blockchain.
