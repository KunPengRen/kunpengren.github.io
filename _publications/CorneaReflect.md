## Abstract
LFace recognition has become increasingly popular as a verification method on
smartphones. But it is vulnerable to attack by perform presentation attacks, which disrupt the face
recognition system by presenting a facial biometric artifact (i.e., photo, video replay, and 3D masks,
etc). In order to mitigate this problem, liveness detection has been proved to be the most promising
techniques for presentation attacks detection, as it is the act of differentiating the feature space into
live and non-living while presentation attacks use non-living facial biometric artifact. Some
researchers and smartphone manufacturers propose to utilize expensive hardware to perform
liveness detection, while others propose lots of complex and infeasible methods. Most existing
approaches are either very expensive due to the use of extra equipment, or infeasible due to
demanding environmental requirements.
In this paper, we propose CorneaReflect, a low-cost and practical face liveness detection
algorithm for smartphone to counter photo-based and video-based attacks. We evaluate the
practicality, robustness and usability of CorneaReflect respectively to demonstrate its efficacy.
Additionally, we compare CorneaReflect with FaceID in iPhone X, and experimental results show
that CorneaReflect can dentify photo-based attack and video-based attack as accurately as FaceID .
